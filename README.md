# Math algorithms

A very simple repository containing math algorithms made by a student of Electrical Engineering.


## About this Project

This content was created without the intention of being used in production, but as a way for me learn and apply the libraries: matplotlib, numpy, scipy, sympy to study math

This does not prevent you from downloading, changing, using and / or distributing your content as you prefer.

## Why?

This project is part of my studies about Python  By doing this I intend that other people could learn with me, and myself could learn with them.


## Functionalities

A list of what I added or still intend to add.

- Limits
- Derivatives
- Integrals
- Domain of a function
- Tangent plane
- Optimization
- Vectors and matrices
- Analytic geometry
- Arc length

The features I haven't added yet, you can help me add them by opening a pull request!

If you have any features that are not on the list you can also send the PR to add them.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project in the development mode, you'll need to have a basic environment to run a Python file.

Also, you need to install the requirements that I put on requirements.txt

### Installing

**Cloning the Repository**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tiagod3p/math-algorithms.git

$ cd math-algorithms
```

**Installing dependencies**

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Contributing

You can send how many PR's do you want, I'll be glad to analyze and accept them! And if you have any question about the project...
